# Mastermind
A fun game of mastermind! 

Can be played as 'Player vs Player' or 'Player vs Bot'

Players can choose the amount of pegs they want to play with (2-10) :) 

Note: Game needs to be played in terminal, or an app similar (e.g.: VS Code works, but PyCharm doesn't if not configured to run using cmd) - this is because the screen is cleared after player 1 chooses the pegs for player 2 to guess... cause otherwise there'd be no competition
